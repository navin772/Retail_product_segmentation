# Retail_Store_ML

This project aims to demonstrate machine learning usecases/applications in the Retail vertical and how it can help retail stores to improve their business and customer experience.

The directories such as `Colgate_segmentation`, `retail_store_heatmap` contains the code for the respective usecases. The `web_application` directory combines all these usecases into a single web application that can be used by the retail store to get insights. Checkout each folder for more details and implementations.

For deploying the web application read the `README.md` file in the `web_application` directory for various types of deployment.
